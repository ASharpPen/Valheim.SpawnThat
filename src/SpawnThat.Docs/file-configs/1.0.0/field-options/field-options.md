# Noise
Noise is set on each player based on certain activities they perform. It is set directly, and does not accumulate, meaning a player chopping trees will have the same noise of 100 for each chop and not increasingly higher.

Certain creatures will treat the noise as a "sound range". This means if the noise is greater than their "hearing" setting, and "noise" is within range of the creature (100 noise is 100 meters), they will react.

Noise constantly decays if no action is performed.
Known causes of noise:
- Dodge: 5
- Punching: 5
- Walking: 15
- Running: 30
- Jumping: 30
- Chopping / Pickaxing: 40
- Remove building piece: 50
- Chopping trees: 100
- Breaking rocks: 100

Apart from that, every attack will have a hit-noise and swing noise. By default this is 30 and 10, but this could be different for each attack type.
