# Changelog: 

- v1.1.0:
	- Added supprt for new SpawnArea spawner type (eg., greydwarf nests).
	- Added custom config file reader. This should hopefully make things more intuitive and less volatile. It does however mean that comments are longer added automatically.
	- Swapped file load and merge order, to make default files override supplemental, as was originally intended (eg., `spawn_that.world_spawners_advanced.cfg` gets loaded after
	- Added datamining for locations, as an option in general config.
	- Removed setting "StopTouchingMyConfigs" from general config, as it has become irrellevant.
	- Fixed bug with attempting to load files as configs if they fit the expected name pattern, even though they didn't end with '.cfg'.
	- Fixed bug where disabling world spawner with `Enabled` disabled the config instead.
`spawn_that.world_spawners.something.cfg` now).
	- A LOT of boring internal changes, logging and documentation that noone will probably ever see or care about.

- v1.0.5:
	- Improved world spawner debug file output. Now tries to output not just the default settings, but the custom too. Including integrations.
	- Fixed world spawner post change debug file not showing the configuration ID's, but instead the internal index they were added at.
	- Fixed world spawner cfg load adding unnecessary option.
	- Fixed faction, biome and cllc setting parsing being case-sensitive. Eg., setting biome as Blackforest would fail to parse as biome BlackForest.
 	- Added installation check for YamlDotNet dll, to ensure it is present.
- v1.0.4:
	- Fixed dungeon room names not being cleaned before registration, causing issues with local spawners matching.
- v1.0.3:
	- Fixed local spawner file-configs not being properly matched with spawners.
	- Fixed error when printing world spawners with missing prefab to debug file.

- v0.11.6:
	- It's the season of bugs! World spawner templates are now instantiated on entering world, meaning changes applied are no longer carried between worlds / re-entering. This is hopefully getting changed by IG in the future.

	- Fixed leftover optimizations causing spawners to get disabled in biomes outside the one player logged into.

	- Added console commands for areas.
	- Added conditions for epic loot based items on nearby players.
